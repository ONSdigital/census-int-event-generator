# Census Event Generator
This repository contains a spring boot based command line runner utility whose purpose is to generate rabbit AMQP messages that conform to the census integration standard message format.
Its primary purpose is as a tool to be used for performance testing to generate messages and pur them into the 'events' exchange, independeant of the intended originating service.
ie it will be used to load test the census RH service, by sending bulk CaseUpdated and UACUpdated messages to the RH service in a GCP environment that does not receive the same messages from 
the RM CaseAPI Service. (ie a sand-box dev or integration environment running only the census int team components)

It has been designed to also allow a non spring boot application, such as the Cucumber integration test tool, to call it programmatically, in order to generate events such that the test may have
 absolute surety of data being sent to the component under test ie RH Service may receive messages generated by this tool, store them in its GCP repository, and then the cucmber test may use the ids generated 
 as fixtures in its tests. This is the only way that cucumber may know the versimmilitude of the data it is basing its assertions on.
 
 The messages will ultimately be generated by the same code that the census integration team are using to generate the messages sent by the teams own components (currently RH Service and the Contact Centre Service)
